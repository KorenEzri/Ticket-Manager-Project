# Introduction

This is a Ticket Manager built with React.js, nodejs and MongoDB. 

## Usage

### PS: I recommend you download the ZIP from the "no-test-branch" and run locally to enjoy the actual working email system and two-factor user Auth.
## Simply visit [this page](https://ko-managge.herokuapp.com/), and get TICKETING! 


A couple of the product's most prominent features include:

## Security: User authentication: hashing, cookie management and validation.
